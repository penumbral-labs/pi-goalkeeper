# pi-goalkeeper

Guarded goal tracking and continuation for pi.

This project is forked from [`pi-codex-goal`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-codex-goal) and preserves its MIT
attribution while we add stronger runtime circuit breakers.

This package adds a `/goal` command plus three model-callable tools:

- `get_goal`
- `create_goal`
- `update_goal`

Goal state is stored in pi session custom entries, so it follows session history, resume, fork, tree navigation, reload,
and compaction behavior without an external database.

`/goal` with no arguments reports the current objective, status, token budget, token usage, and elapsed active time. A
plain `/goal <objective>` starts a new goal or replaces the current one after confirmation.

This intentionally matches Codex TUI behavior: token budgets are set through the model tool rather than parsed from
`/goal --tokens`. This package keeps its objective size limit at 8000 Unicode characters.

## Model Tools

`create_goal` starts a goal with an objective and optional positive token budget. It fails if a goal already exists.

`get_goal` returns the current goal state and usage.

`update_goal` only accepts `status: "complete"`, matching Codex's model-side contract. The extension reports final token
and elapsed-time usage before marking the goal complete.

## Behavior

While a goal is active, the extension:

- tracks elapsed active time between turns and tool completions
- adds completed assistant turn input plus output token usage when the active model reports it
- pauses when an active assistant turn is aborted, such as when you press Esc
- prompts on session resume before reactivating a paused goal, and resumes explicitly with `/goal resume`
- marks the goal `budgetLimited` when a positive token budget is reached
- sends hidden steering messages when budget is reached or when the agent is idle but the goal is still active
- shows Codex-style status labels with compact token or elapsed-time usage in the pi footer when UI is available

Token counts are formatted with commas and compact abbreviations, for example `123M (123,456,789) tokens`. Token totals
use pi's completed assistant turn input plus output usage. Cache read and cache write channels are excluded because they
are provider cache accounting fields, not extra sent and received text tokens. Pi does not currently expose a separate
extension usage total for automatic compaction summary calls.
